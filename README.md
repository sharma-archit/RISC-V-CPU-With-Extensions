# 64-Bit RISC-V CPU

This project is built upon my previous 32-bit RISC-V CPU project. The goal of this project is to implement all of the ratified RISC-V ISA extensions as of version 20240411:

- RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set ✅ (**Implemented**)
- Zifencei Extension for Instruction-Fetch Fence (WIP)
- Zicsr Extension for Control and Status Register (CSR) Instructions (WIP)
- Zicntr and Zihpm Extensions for Counters (WIP)
- Zihintntl Extension for Non-Temporal Locality Hints (WIP)
- Zihintpause Extension for Pause Hint (WIP)
- Zimop Extension for May-Be-Operations (WIP)
- Zicond Extension for Integer Conditional Operations (WIP)
- M Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division (WIP)
- A Extension for Atomic Instructions (WIP)
- Zawrs Extension for Wait-on-Reservation-Set instructions (WIP)
- Zacas Extension for Atomic Compare-and-Swap (CAS) Instructions (WIP)
- Ztso Extension for Total Store Ordering (WIP)
- CMO Extensions for Base Cache Management Operation ISA (WIP)
- F Extension for Single-Precision Floating-Point (WIP)
- D Extension for Double-Precision Floating-Point (WIP)
- Q Extension for Quad-Precision Floating-Point (WIP)
- Zfh and Zfhmin Extensions for Half-Precision Floating-Point (WIP)
- Zfa Extension for Additional Floating-Point Instructions (WIP)
- Zfinx, Zdinx, Zhinx, Zhinxmin Extensions for Floating-Point in Integer Registers (WIP)
- B Extension for Bit Manipulation (WIP)
- V Standard Extension for Vector Operations (WIP)
- Cryptography Extensions: Scalar & Entropy Source Instructions (WIP)
- Cryptography Extensions: Vector Instructions (WIP)
